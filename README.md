# python_scripts
My Personal Python Scripts

These are python scripts i have made to practice use of python for automation purposes and also making these scripts installable as a package or packages (IDK at the time of writing this)

Scripts
1. create_project (Started 31/10/2022)
A python script that helps me create a whole basic project setup on my PC like make the projects folder, a python environment, generate a requirements.txt file when i close a project and commit changes to my github when I'm done for the day. More in the projects folder (project_creation_scripts)
